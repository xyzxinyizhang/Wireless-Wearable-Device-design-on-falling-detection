# Wireless Wearable Device design on falling-detection

This project designs and implement falling detection algorithm in FPGA. The main work include: 1) data fetch from accelerator and gyroscope. 2) data fetch finite state machine design. 3) deduct and mesaure the trigger value for falling detection 4) a transmission from FPGA bluetooth to smart phone.

1. This project is based on Lattice ICE40 FPGA.
2. The project is written in System Verilog and VHDL.
